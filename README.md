  <li>Firebase(for authentication and firestore db)</li>
</ui>

<h2>Brief Description</h2>

<p>This project is a personal learning exercise built to replicate a static design concept made by a friend, envisioning a better UI/UX for the Glo Mobile App.
The goal is to understand and implement fundamental concepts of React Native by developing a simplified version of a data-purchasing mobile app. 
Itâ€™s not meant to be a production-level application but rather a training ground for learning and improvement.  
</p>

<h3>Features Currently On The App</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sign up function along with a Sign and Log in function assisted by firebase tool</li>
  <li>Sign up function consisting of a page providing inputs for users such as profile picture, username , full name and phone number</li>
  <li>A usable airtime and data purchasing component function that works in sync with the firebase database</li>
  <li>A mini profile consisting of your username and also accessible for you to view in your details</li>
  <li>A balance display that displays your current airtime and data balance and is also updatable through the purchase function</li>
  <li>History Tracking for all purchases made</li>
</ul>

<p>This app is a work-in-progress and will be revisited frequently for polish and upgrades as I grow my understanding of React Native and mobile app development in general</p>
